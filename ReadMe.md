I publish my lecture notes for the lecture

Algebraic Topology I held by Stefan Schwede at the university of Bonn in Winter 2025/26 here.

This is only true, as long as I'm not completely overwhelmed by my other lectures, I might stop doing this midway in the semester.

Huge thanks to Daniel Emse for providing the Class and .sty files
